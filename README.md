## Dataset
MNIST is a widely used dataset for the hand-written digit classification task. It consists of 70,000 labelled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model using the 60,000 training images and subsequently test its classification accuracy on the 10,000 test images.

## Features
Each digit image is 28x28 pixel. In the data set, each sample is represented by a normalized 28x28=784 dimensional vector.
